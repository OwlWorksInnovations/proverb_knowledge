# What is this?
This tool is designed to help you make choices, I personally ask for advice before I do anything im unsure of and it will answer with quotes from the book of proverbs. What is the book of proverbs? Well its commonly known as the book of whisdom. It contains wise sayings, moral instructions, and practical advice.

# Framework
Never heard of eel? Well its a amazing framework. With it being so easy to set up and use I don't think I will ever go back to electron or tauri, mostly because I struggled and never got practical use out of them. Its memory footprint is larger than tauri but only by 30ish mb and of course depending on what you do with python. I recommend it to beginners because it uses python, html, css and javascript which are all begginer friendly.
